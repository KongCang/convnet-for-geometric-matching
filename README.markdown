Get the code necessary for generating random transformation matrices from [this repo](https://github.com/hjweide/daug).

**This is a work-in-progress**.  Pull requests are welcome.  Contact me if you run into issues using the code.

The thin-plate-spline has not yet been implemented.  The model has not been
trained properly yet, either.  The images below were taken from the validation
set after training for 300 epochs (about 17 hours on a TITAN X).  The image on
the left is the center crop, the image in the middle is the result of applying
the ground-truth transformation to the center crop, and the image on the right
is the result of applying the predicted transformation to the warped image (in
other words, the pose of the rightmost image should resemble that of the
leftmost image).
